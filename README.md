I use vscode and copilot to develop - i need a solid solution that solves my constant crashing and inconsistancy problems. i would have multiple workspaces open with multiple chat sessions could even have up to 8 or more open when i am really hitting hard. 

this will be on a physical server with GPU so use it anyway possible that will help 

want to keep proviles consistant, want to have oauth enabled so i can work knowingits save, it must live inside the GCP-landing-zone repo

public dns is elevatediq.ai/code-server oauth protected https/ssl/ full landing zone mandates and reqirements
