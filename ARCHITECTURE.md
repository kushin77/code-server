# Architecture

This file should describe the high-level architecture of the `code-server` project.

Suggested sections:
- Overview and goals
- Components and responsibilities
- Data flow and integrations (GCP services, CI/CD)
- Terraform layer mapping (if IaC present)
- Observability and logging

Add diagrams as `docs/diagrams/` or link externally.
